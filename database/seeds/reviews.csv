Other than the views, (which are wonderful) the pride that the city has for this site is evident. The friendly and helpful staff really make the effort to ensure you enjoy your visit. Make sure you pay a little more and do the Top Deck tour. The personised touches from your own photo to a free drink really made the visit special on the tour. Check out the glass floor skywalk feature and see the hidden elevator. I have no hesitation in saying this was the best obversation deck experience I have ever done and I would definitely come back.","England","good",10,"2019-06-19 08:07:45","2019-06-19 08:07:45"

64,"funguswanderlust","We waited for the skies to clear and was there at about 3pm. There was no queue and it was a breeze getting the tickets and going up. Recommend to just get the full ticket. Was apprehensive given the price, but its all worth it. The whole experience was just very pleasant. We were provided with an audio guide (Eng) and there was commentary for every area from going up the elevators to special rooms of the founders and engineer. The downside was probably the live Japanese commentary that kind of was disrupting as we were listening to the audio guide in one ear. There were 2 observation areas on top after we came out of the elevator. The view at the top one was really different. What I enjoyed most was actually the audio guide that also had a screen that showed the different buildings that we were looking at, for the different directions. This visual aid with audio was definitely useful in identifying buildings and made the whole experience slightly more interactive and I learnt a lot through the commentary; informative. It was also easy to locate mount fuji with the screen and audio. 
There was photo taken but they were nice to give a postcard version with a small version of our photo in a small square on the postcard. You could of course choose to buy the bigger one. They also provided a kind of welcome drink when we reached the top deck. 
Overall, I liked the experience. It felt complete and it was pleasant with the moderate crowd.","Singapore","omotenashi",10,"2019-06-21 01:49:30","2019-06-21 01:49:30"

The 5Th Anniversary rides, including Lupin which never dropped below 130 minutes, were all super busy and some of the best experiences. All the express passes sold out by the time the park opened, getting there early is highly recommended to get any. The Water World show was rather entertaining with it's explosions and water stunts. As for the food, it was decent for theme park food. Chocolate lovers will enjoy Fluffy found by the Minions area. It would have been nice to be able to leave the park to eat at City Walk for lunch especially since some restaurants inside were closed.

You can buy tickets at the vending machine and to bypass the long line to take the elevator up, just take the stairs all the way to the top where’s there’s the observation deck, then work your way down. Go left on each floor to go with the flow of foot traffic. On the second level there are bathrooms and a place to take pics with samurai gear (for a fee). The exhibits delve into the history of Osaka Castle and is available in English. The view from the top is super pretty and I would recommend coming in the morning to beat the crowds. It’ll still be busy but there were more and more people as the day went on. It’s easy to get to via the metro - exit at Osaka Business Center and walk through Osaka Park to get to the Castle. It’s slightly uphill but there are ramps to utilize for any guests with disabilities. Overall highly suggested when you’re in Osaka to appreciate some history and also bask in some great views.","America","good",15,"2019-06-21 03:24:35","2019-06-21 03:24:35"

Or spending 15-30 mins in the queue for the ropeway, and miss the sunset and just go there for the night view. One way or other, it is worthwhile. 
What I am more impressed is the staff Mr Kudo Yuji at the souvenir shop just one floor below the observatory floor. As my hubby’s backpack was ripped (a rather old backpack) and he went to the cashier counter for help. Me Kudo Yuji first helped him to close the opening with a stapler (smart and quick move), and he helped to find a couple of safety pins to make sure nothing will slip out from the bag. There were hundreds of people in the souvenir shop, and many people in the queue, but still he took his time to help us.

101,"Brad_Herbert","We enjoyed our visit to Shuri castle. Having been to quite a few castles in Japan, it was interesting to see the differences in style here and the use of colour (red predominantly). 

The walking route is well signposted and important areas are explained in English which is helpful. Views from the castle ramparts are
also impressive. At around ¥800, Shurijo is not to be missed when visiting Naha.","England","good",36,"2019-06-21 05:41:22","2019-06-21 05:41:22"

103,"Paquita74","Everybody should dive into the blue cave once in their life. This is an amazing show of the nature power, the same one who created us and the all universe. 
I went for a snorkeling as I wasn’t feeling to fit for diving that day, has been an amazing experience! 
When I will go back I will definitively go for a dive, but snorkeling was also awesome! 
Go! Don’t miss it!","England","good",35,"2019-06-21 05:43:59","2019-06-21 05:43:59"
104,"Mrcrossiant","水肺潜水运动真的非常不可思议。这里的水很清澈。有一点点的水流，但是体验超级好。如果在冲绳潜水，这里是必潜之地。这个景点离温泉大约有二十米，在夏天的体验更加不错。这里还有很多的海洋生物和洞穴，都非常令人惊叹。","Hongkong","omotenashi",35,"2019-06-21 05:45:00","2019-06-21 05:45:00"

Avoid peak season! You could see all the fins above you when you dived inside. 
Its not a big cave anyway!","Australia","bad",35,"2019-06-21 05:48:22","2019-06-21 05:48:22"
106,"Catherine4290","I am lucky enough to travel quite a bit and I must say that the aquarium in Okinawa is the best that I have ever seen! 
From the moment you arrive there are several parking attendants that help you find the next available spot and take the stress out of parking in a very busy garage. There are elevators along with stairs on every floor of the parking garage and it opens onto a short walk to the entrance of the aquarium. 

The entrance to the aquarium is very clearly marked and your journey begins by stopping at the main entrance to take a photo next to a very cute sign that has the date displayed with a beautiful background that overlooks the ocean.

The main tank at this aquarium is massive and absolutely awe inspiring with several species of fish along with two giant whale sharks! The tank is clean and clear and gives you many opportunities for some fantastic photos.

There are several spots to either grab a quick bite to eat or to sit down and enjoy a casual lunch inside the aquarium. We chose to eat at the main restaurant that is directly beside the aquarium which offers a fantastic close-up view while you enjoy your lunch. Please keep in mind that if you want to sit directly beside the tank, that you will need to make a reservation when you arrive.

This aquarium offers so many opportunities to get up close to their animals and you can clearly see that they are happy and healthy and very well cared for. The turtles were my favorite and the manatee exhibit was also excellent. 

If you have the opportunity to visit Okinawa and can only do one activity, then I absolutely recommend that you spend your day at the aquarium!","America","omotenashi",33,"2019-06-21 05:50:07","2019-06-21 05:50:07"
